# How to run Pluto on binder

You can use binder to run notebooks for free on the web.

### Option A: try in your browser
Go to [plutojl.org/#try](https://plutojl.org/#try) to learn how you can start Pluto directly in your browser, without having to install Julia. This is great for trying out Pluto, but it's not ideal when you want to save your work.

### Option B: a notebook file
Every HTML export that you create with Pluto will come with an "Edit or run" button built-in, which lets you run the notebook with binder. That means that you can share a notebook, and use it to start a binder session.

To use this feature, just [Export your notebook to HTML](https://plutojl.org/en/docs/export-html/). Now you can open the HMTL file, or share it with someone else. [pluto.land](https://pluto.land) is an easy way to share notebooks!

# Automatic Binder and HTML exports
If you have a repository with Pluto notebooks and you want to automatically generate HTML exports with a Binder button using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages, take a look at our [template repository](https://github.com/JuliaPluto/static-export-template).


# ðŸ‘€ Note

This is the public repository that gets launched behind the scenes when you use a link generated by [https://pluto-on-binder.glitch.me/](https://pluto-on-binder.glitch.me/).

You probably do **not** want to fork this repository and use it for another project, **these instruction will come soon**. This is also **not** the recommended way to install Pluto as a jupyter extension. For this, we are working on https://github.com/fonsp/pluto-on-jupyterlab.

Reading the source code of this repository might be confusing! But to Pluto's developers: have a look at the different branches, the master branch is for the demo link, all other branches are for other experiments.
